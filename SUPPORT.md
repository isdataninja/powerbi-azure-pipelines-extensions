issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates. For new issues, file your bug or 
feature request as a new issue.

The log file contains information about the REST calls sent to Power BI including URL and body. When creating a GitHub issue, it's recomended to add the entire log file of your task run. For your privacy, make sure you remove any personal information before posting the log.
